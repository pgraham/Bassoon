# Bassoon

Bassoon is a remote service proxy generator for PHP.  It will take as input the
name of a specially annotated PHP class and generate a Javascript file which
provides a client interface to a service defined by the class.  The generated
javascript required jQuery and the jQuery Cookie plugin.
